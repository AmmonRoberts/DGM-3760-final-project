User Stories

1. As a user, I want to search for cool APIs to look at
2. As a user, I want to save APIs for later
3. As a user, I want to be able to "favorite" APIs
4. As a user, I want to see random APIs
5. As a user, I want to be able to search to search by different categories
6. As a user, I want to I want my saved lists to be persistent

Yeah, this is definitely not 15 user stories, which is for sure awesome, but I'm already super late and stuff.

Also, I have no idea why the deployed version isn't saving to the database correctly, but it works locally...

This is lacking a huge amount, and I'm definitely aware of that. Also, why even did I do that awkward purple gradient background? Who even knows? Not me.
